How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It makes it easy for me to find the differences.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It can help me to find the bugs, understand what changes I did and also better understand what I did.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Possibility to save my new version whenever I want, and adding message that is meaningful for later.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because it's used for code, so a lot of files can be change in a single commit.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    To check the changes I did.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because I'm sure to find it easily if I want to revert or go to another version of my work.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To better manage my projects and collaborate with others
